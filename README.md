Project description:

Slimekoban is a maze-ified version of the classic puzzle game Sokoban feature an adorable slime as the main sprite!

To play Slimekoban, you must have Java 17/21 installed in order to run Kilt Graphics. The main class is called "MainGame", and the game is run from there. The other classes will not run gameplay. Use the up/down/left/right arrows to control the slime and move through the maze. The slime can only move one space at a time, users cannot hold down keys to move multiple squares at once.Crates, which are colored brown, can be pushed around by the slime. Note that they cannot stack, as in multiple crates cannot be moved at once.

Art credit for the slime sprite goes to our very own Maren Good, who designed the pixel art herself!
Many thanks to Lewis Libby Watt and Paul Cantrell for their guidance in developping this project, and to Hiroyuki Imabayashi for inventing the original Sokoban game in 1981.

There are only two levels of the game thus far, and once the second level is completed, the game will quit automatically despite the screen reading "Generating next maze...".

Slimekoban is a game intended for simple, puzzle solving fun. We do not anticipate any harmful or malicious uses of this game.
Slimekoban uses the up/down/left/right arrow keys for gameplay, so if a user does not use a keyboard, they will not be able to control the sprite. For users with low vision/blindness, there are no elements other than visual in Slimekoban, rendering it challenging to play. There is a small amount of text that appears between levels that may or may not be able to be read by a screen reader. There may also be an issue with distinguishing colors if a user has color processesing issues, future iterations of this game will include more patterns/texture to distinguish different game elements from each other.
